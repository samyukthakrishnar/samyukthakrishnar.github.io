# Hello, I'm [Samyuktha Krishna R] ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my digital space! I'm a first year Electrical and Computer engineering student, with an insatiable curiosity for innovation and problem-solving.

## What Drives Me ðŸš€

As an ELC student, I'm genuinely **curious about AI/ML and Web Development** - fields that perfectly blend creativity with logic. There's something magical about writing code that can think, learn, and solve real-world problems. I'm just  beginning my adventure in the world of technology. While I'm a **beginner in coding**, I'm incredibily passionate about extending my knowledge across multiple domains.Everyday brings new discoveries in the fascinating intersection of electrical systems and computer science.
My interests don't stop at conventional tech. I'm fascinated by **electric vehicles, especially Tesla** - the intersection of software, hardware, and sustainable innovation. It's incredible how technology can reshape our entire relationship with transportation and energy- the perfect intersection of my ELC background with cutting-edge software innovation.

## My Philosophy ðŸ’«

I believe in putting **full effort into developing skills** in my areas of interest. Every challenge is an opportunity to grow, every project a chance to push boundaries.

## Beyond Code ðŸŽ¨

When I'm not immersed in algorithms and APIs, you'll find me:
- **Journaling** - capturing thoughts, ideas, and daily reflections
- **Painting and Doodling** - expressing creativity on canvas and paper
- Exploring the intersection between art and technology*Ready to build the future.*
